Description: The TempleMetrics package contains functions for estimating the conditional distributions or conditional quantiles.  The versions of the methods in this package are primarily for use in multiple step procedures where the first step is to estimate a conditional distribution.  In particular, there are functions for implementing Distribution Regression.  Distribution Regression provides a way to flexibly model the distribution of some outcome Y conditional on covariates X without imposing parametric assumptions on the conditional distribution but providing more structure than fully nonparametric estimation (See Foresi and Peracchi (1995) <doi:10.2307/2291056> and Chernozhukov, Fernandez-Val, and Melly (2013) <doi:10.3982/ECTA10582>).
